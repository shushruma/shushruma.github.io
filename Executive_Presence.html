									<p>As defined by Sylvia Ann Hewlett, Executive presence is “a measure of image: wether you signal to others that you have what it takes, that you're star material.” In a way its the way you who you are. Its the adjectives people use to describe you. There are three main pillars to Executive presence: gravitas, communication, and appearance. Ultimately, learning to have a better executive presence is one of the key factors of successful leaders.  </p>
                                    
                                    <h5 class="heading5">Gravitas</h5>
                                    <p> Merriam-Webster dictionary simply defines gravitas as “high seriousness”. To mean gravitas refers the the manner which you behave in moments that require high seriousness. "Gravitas, according to 62 percent of the leaders we surveyed, is what signals to the world you’re made of the right stuff and can be entrusted with serious responsibilities (Hewlett 16).” Stated by senior leaders researched in the book, confidence and grace under fire, decisiveness, integrity, emotional intelligence, pedigree and charisma are the top characteristics of gravitas. The first, grace under fire, is about we choose to handle ourselves in the face of adversity. Ultimately mistakes are inevitable and some times even out of our control, but our reactions and the way we handle ourselves as a reaction is very much in our control. Decisiveness isn’t just about the ability to make decisions, it's about how we make those decisions. "Real leaders listen, gather critical information, weigh the options carefully, look for a timely opening (typically when everyone else is writhing in indecision), and then demand action (25).” We’ve all faced situations where honesty is the hardest policy. Integrity, is about honesty through our actions even when it takes each and every ounce of energy to stand by that truth. The ability to gauge the emotional temperature of a  room and choose how much you choose to show of your self is an incredibly important aspect of a strong leader. Sometimes we have to learn to handle the professional version of "how to soothe your friend after a bad break up.” You may have a friend who needs to down her sorrows in a tub of ice cream or a friend who chooses to hit the gym and drop 20 lbs. Similarly, at work there are certain employees who may need an extra push and some who prefer to be given free reign. Emotional intelligence is important so that you can learn hot to best support the people around you.  </p>
                                            
                                            
                                    <h5 class="heading5">Communication</h5>
                                    <p>Wether in a large auditorium or an intimate gathering, communication it's not just the words that we use, but how we use them. Creating connection is a vital part of grasping audience’s attention and there is no better way than telling a captivating story. People prefer short and to the point stories supported by evidence and data. Another aspect of effective communication is how we talk. The speed, pitch, grammar, and vocabulary we use are just as important. Assertiveness communicates our ability to stick and push a decision or a thought forward. Women often struggle with being assertive compared to their male counterparts and even when they do they can be labeled bossy. Hewlett suggests women to stick by their decisions and even offer up an explanation when appropriate. Finally, building lasting connections off the stage is the reason can be the reason why people decide to pay attention to you on stage. By networking and maintaining a casual repertoire with others gives them a compelling reason to listen when you are talking. </p>
                                            
                                    <h5 class="heading5">Appearance</h5>
                                    <p>As they say, “dress for the position you want, not the position you have.” In the professional world, maintaining a groomed and polished look paired with appropriately styled clothes signal that you are in control of yourself. Learning appropriate body language can only boost your executive presence. Hewlett continues in the book to address a question that was looming in my mind as she describes appropriate gravitas, communications, and appearance.</p>
                                            
                                    <h5 class="heading5">Authenticity</h5>
                                    <p>When we focus so much on controlling and crafting our image as talked about above, where do we draw the line between authenticity and duplicity? The guidelines stated above should be used to help create a clear image of who we are. Everyone has to figure out what image they would like to put out for the world to see and find a way to display that through our executive presence. </p>
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            <div class="post-title pt-30 mb-30">
	                                    
	                                        <h4 class ="heading5">My Thoughts</h4>
	                                </div>
                                            
                                    <p> This book was a quick read because it talks about all the awkward things people may not feel comfortable saying in a professional setting. Ranging from the importance of maintaining a lower pitched voice to learning how to appropriately “show teeth” or assertiveness, I learned so much from this book. I seem myself coming back to refer to classic timeless tips to navigating the corporate world. This is a must read book for anyone trying to make an impact in a leadership position. "Executive Presence" is like the foundation of a house, the most basic element of a strong leader. It helps the reader create a strong platform to them to continue to build their leadership on. </p>
